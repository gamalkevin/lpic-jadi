# Preface
As the title suggest, I'm planning to get [LPIC-1 certification](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/lpic-1-overview/). Since I have no capital to invest in a 'serious' class for this, I'm going to use a free resource. 

That's where [Jadi](https://www.youtube.com/c/geekingjadi), a veteran programmer who shares his knowledge through his YouTube channel, comes with his wonderful playlist of [LPIC 1 (Version 500)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFOYXCPEqdNUU55Xvgst8wGTWnz_sd-cj). People in the comments are praising and vouching Jadi for his exam-accurate and super helpful content. 

*My lazy ass* kept procrastinating the learning process. We're already halfway through the month, and I'm just getting started. *Well, better late than never!*

I have already watched video 001 through 003, which covers the basics and installation of two labs (Fedora and Ubuntu), so I'll skip the notes of both, since I already know how to do it without watching the video. However, see the next file for the documentation of labs that I prepared.

## Target & Learning Strategy
I target to finish at least 1 video daily *(with strict adherence to '**the strategy**')*. The strategy is as follows:
- Watch the video **twice**.
	- First is watching the video by itself in **1.25x speed**, without jotting anything. I aim to get familiar with the flow.
	- Second is watching the video in its normal speed, and pausing whenever necessary to take down notes.
- After watching the video, skim-read again the written note; and
- Practice/redo actions from the video *(if applicable)*

## Current Progress
As of **10 Sept 2025**, I'm watching video [004](https://youtu.be/xCPDxgp0zXY?si=8ce2ZOach2HerWf_&t=9).
