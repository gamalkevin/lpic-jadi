As the title suggest, I'm planning to get [LPIC-1 certification](# Linux Professional Institute LPIC-1). Since I have no capital to invest in a 'serious' class for this, I'm going to use a free resource. 

That's where [Jadi](https://www.youtube.com/c/geekingjadi), a veteran programmer who shares his knowledge through his YouTube channel comes with his wonderful playlist of [LPIC 1 (Version 500)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFOYXCPEqdNUU55Xvgst8wGTWnz_sd-cj). People in the comments are praising Jadi for the accurate and super helpful content. 

My lazy ass kept procrastinating the learning process. We're already halfway through the month, and I'm just getting started. *Well, better late than never!*

I have already watched video 001 through 003, which covers the basics and installation of two labs (Fedora and Ubuntu), so I'll skip the notes of both, since I already know how to do it without watching the video.
# Current Progress
As of **10 Sept 2025**, I'm watching video [004](https://youtu.be/xCPDxgp0zXY?si=8ce2ZOach2HerWf_&t=9).
