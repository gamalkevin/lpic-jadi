# Preface
*Moved the actual preface  to [README.md](/README.md)*

## Target & Learning Strategy
I target to finish at least 1 video daily *(with strict adherence to '**the strategy**')*. The strategy is as follows:
- Watch the video **twice**.
	- First is watching the video by itself in **1.25x speed**, without jotting anything. I aim to get familiar with the flow.
	- Second is watching the video in its normal speed, and pausing whenever necessary to take down notes.
- After watching the video, skim-read again the written note; and
- Practice/redo actions from the video *(if applicable)*

## Current Progress
As of **10 Sept 2025**, I'm watching video [004](https://youtu.be/xCPDxgp0zXY?si=8ce2ZOach2HerWf_&t=9).
