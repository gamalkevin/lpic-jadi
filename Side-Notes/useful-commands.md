# Useful Personal Commands

During my LPIC learning, I came across these useful commands. I'll write them down here, so they will stick with me in the long term.

## ðŸª™ `cat`
`cat` is primarily used for concatenating and displaying file contents (mainly text/logs). Its name is an abbreviation of "**concatenate.**"

### Common Options
Basic options
- `-n`,Â `--number`: Number all output lines, starting at 1.
- `-b`,Â `--number-nonblank`: Number non-blank output lines, starting at 1. OverridesÂ `-n`.
- `-s`,Â `--squeeze-blank`: Squeeze multiple consecutive blank lines into a single blank line.
- `-u`: Forces unbuffered output, writing each byte as it is read. Most useful when dealing with real-time devices.Â 

Options for showing special characters:
- `-E`,Â `--show-ends`: Display aÂ `$`Â at the end of each line.
- `-T`,Â `--show-tabs`: Display tab characters asÂ `^I`.
- `-v`,Â `--show-nonprinting`: Display non-printing characters (except for tabs and newlines) usingÂ `^`Â andÂ `M-`Â notation.
- `-e`: Equivalent toÂ `-vE`. Displays non-printing characters and aÂ `$`Â at the end of each line.
- `-t`: Equivalent toÂ `-vT`. Displays non-printing characters and tabs asÂ `^I`.
- `-A`,Â `--show-all`: Equivalent toÂ `-vET`. Displays all non-printing characters, line endings, and tabs.Â

## ðŸª™ `grep`
One of the most useful tool to search text.

### Common options forÂ `grep`
Case and pattern matching
- **`-i`**,Â `--ignore-case`: Ignore case distinctions, treating "Pattern" and "pattern" as the same.
- **`-w`**,Â `--word-regexp`: Match the pattern only when it forms a whole word, not a substring.
- **`-x`**,Â `--line-regexp`: Select matches that are entire lines.
- **`-E`**,Â `--extended-regexp`: Interpret the pattern as an extended regular expression (ERE), which enables more powerful features likeÂ `|`Â for "OR".
- **`-F`**,Â `--fixed-strings`: Interpret the pattern as a list of fixed strings, not regular expressions. This is faster for searching literal text.
- **`-f file`**: Obtain patterns from a file, with one pattern per line.
- **`-e pattern`**: Use multiple patterns for searching.Â 

Output control
- **`-v`**,Â `--invert-match`: Invert the search to display all lines thatÂ **do not**Â match the pattern.
- **`-n`**,Â `--line-number`: Prefix each line of output with the corresponding line number from the input file.
- **`-c`**,Â `--count`: Suppress normal output and instead print a count of the number of matching lines.
- **`-l`**,Â `--files-with-matches`: Print only the names of files that contain at least one match.
- **`-L`**,Â `--files-without-match`: Print only the names of files that containÂ **no**Â matching lines.
- **`-o`**,Â `--only-matching`: Print only the matched part of a line, with each match on a new line.
- **`-q`**,Â `--quiet`,Â `--silent`: Suppress all output.Â `grep`Â will exit with a status code of 0 if a match was found and 1 if not, which is useful for scripting.
- **`-s`**,Â `--no-messages`: Suppress error messages about non-existent or unreadable files.
- **`--color=auto`**: Highlight the matching text in the output.Â 

Context control
- **`-A n`**,Â `--after-context=n`: PrintÂ `n`Â lines of trailing contextÂ **after**Â each match.
- **`-B n`**,Â `--before-context=n`: PrintÂ `n`Â lines of leading contextÂ **before**Â each match.
- **`-C n`**,Â `--context=n`: PrintÂ `n`Â lines of contextÂ **before and after**Â each match.Â 

File and directory search

- **`-r`**,Â `--recursive`: Search recursively through all files in a directory and its subdirectories.
- **`-R`**,Â `--dereference-recursive`: Similar toÂ `-r`, but follows all symbolic links.
- **`-h`**,Â `--no-filename`: Suppress the prefixing of file names on output when searching multiple files.
- **`-H`**,Â `--with-filename`: Always print the file name for each match.
- **`-I`**: Process a binary file as if it did not contain matching data.

## ðŸª™ Piping `dmesg` with `grep`
```
$ sudo dmesg | grep -i 'amd'
```
While learning about `dmesg` with Jadi, I tested running the command to see what my system has to say.  

Turns out, it brought a long wall of textâ€”duhâ€”making it quite hard to read. 

Suddenly it came up to me to chain the command with `grep`, a tool commonly used for scouring logs. Sure enough, the output was nicely filtered, having only specified to list  `amd`. It even colorized the keyword!

---

## ðŸª™ `file`

Very useful to see what type of files is being accessed. 

### Case example
I'm looking for a text file to edit, but since the file has no visible file extensions like `.txt` or `.sh`, it is useful to look what type of file it is beforehand:
```
file /etc/default/grub

/etc/default/grub: ASCII text
```


Another example, I want to make sure that I'm looking for a binary executable:
```
file /usr/lib/firefox/firefox

firefox: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 4.4.0, BuildID[sha1]=2400217cbd14b7b71a44599075a3170d4cefdaad, stripped
```
