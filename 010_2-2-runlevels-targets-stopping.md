# 010 - 101.3 - Part 2 of 2 - Runlevels and targets, Stopping the System and Informing
 Part 2 of **LPIC Topic 101.3: Change runlevels / boot targets and shutdown or reboot system**.

In the early days, computers are shared and centralized, usually in universities or research centers. Multiple users can log in into the same computer, even remotely, at the same time. 

So what happens when an admin wants to restart or shutdown the computer for maintenance purpose? Surely they can't just pull the plug on the computer. People are still working on the system and can lose their WIPs.

With that in mind, admins needed a way to:
1. Stop users from logging in,
2. Send an 'announcement' that the system will be powered off/reboot soon, so users have time to save their progress.
