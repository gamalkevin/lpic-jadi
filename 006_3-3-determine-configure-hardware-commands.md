# 005 - Part 2 of 3 - Determine and Configure Hardware, Commands ðŸ“£
After learning about hardware, let's take a look into the 'basic' commands that touch them.

## **lsusb, lspci, lsblk, lshw**
If the command `ls` lists files, these commands list their respective hardwares. 

### lsusb
This command lists all USB devices connected to the system. Let's see mine:
```
$ lsusb
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 25a7:fa55 Areson Technology Corp Fantech Helios Pro Wireless XD3 
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 04ca:3015 Lite-On Technology Corp. Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377 Bluetooth
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 0408:a031 Quanta Computer, Inc. VGA WebCam
Bus 003 Device 003: ID 0bda:8179 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8188EUS 802.11n Wireless Network Adapter
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
```

### lspci
- Lists hardware connected through the PCI/PCIe bus (common connection method inside computers).
- *Examples: graphics card, network card, sound card, USB controllers.*
```

```
*Quite a list, huh? Wait 'till you see `lshw`.*

### lsblk
This is almost like a personal favorite; I use it a lot whenever doing partitioning or tinkering with USB bootables.

`lsblk` means **list block devices**. Block devices are devices that read/write in fixed-size blocks (e.g., hard drives, SSDs, USB sticks, partitions, even **loop devices** or **RAM disks**).
```
$ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda      8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk 
â”œâ”€sda1   8:1    0   250G  0 part 
â”œâ”€sda2   8:2    0   500M  0 part /boot
â”œâ”€sda3   8:3    0   215G  0 part /
â”œâ”€sda4   8:4    0   300M  0 part /boot/efi
â”œâ”€sda5   8:5    0 372.6G  0 part 
â”œâ”€sda6   8:6    0   732M  0 part 
â”œâ”€sda7   8:7    0  30.7G  0 part 
â””â”€sda8   8:8    0  61.7G  0 part 
sdb      8:16   0 119.2G  0 disk 
â”œâ”€sdb1   8:17   0   499M  0 part 
â”œâ”€sdb2   8:18   0   100M  0 part 
â”œâ”€sdb3   8:19   0    16M  0 part 
â”œâ”€sdb4   8:20   0 117.9G  0 part 
â””â”€sdb5   8:21   0   741M  0 part 
```

#### Column meanings
**`MAJ:MIN` (Major:Minor number)**
- These are **device numbers** that the kernel uses internally.
- **Major**: identifies the driver for the device type (e.g., all SCSI/SATA disks share major number `8`).
- **Minor**: identifies the specific device or partition (e.g., `sda` is `8:0`, `sdb` is `8:16`, partitions increment from there).
- Users usually donâ€™t need to care, but itâ€™s how `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb1`, etc. are mapped.

**`RM` (Removable)**
- Shows whether the device is **removable** (`1`) or not (`0`).
- Example:
    - `sda` (internal HDD/SSD) â†’ `0`
    - `sdb` (USB stick) â†’ `1`

**`RO` (Read-Only)**
- Shows whether the device is **read-only** (`1`) or not (`0`).
- Example:
    - Normal drives â†’ `0`
    - Mounted ISO file or write-protected USB â†’ `1`

### lshw
- Stands for **List Hardware**.
- Shows **detailed information** about the system's hardware, and goes much deeper than `lsblk`, `lspci`, or `lsusb`.
- *Covers: CPU, RAM, motherboard, firmware/BIOS, storage, network cards, etc.*

Running `lshw` by itself, you will be suggested to run it with elevated commands, since it will yield more accurate results. I won't post my full `lshw` here, since it's incredibly long. 
- Even using `-short` option, it will still list all classes of hardware installed in your system. 
- You might want to run it using `-class` option, so it's easier to read through.
