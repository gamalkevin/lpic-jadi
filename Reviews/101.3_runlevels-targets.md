# Answers Evaluation ✅️
I used ChatGPT to evaluate my answers.

### 🧾 **LPIC-1 101.3: Runlevels, Boot Targets & Safe Shutdown — Answer Key**

|#|Your Answer|✅ Correct|Explanation|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1**|❌ **b**|✅ **c**|`halt -n` skips syncing disks and can corrupt data. The safe way to power off is `shutdown -P now`, which cleanly stops all processes and unmounts filesystems.|
|**2**|✅ **c**|✅|Correct — Runlevel **3** is the standard multi-user mode with networking (no GUI).|
|**3**|✅ **b**|✅|Good — `runlevel` shows the previous and current runlevel, e.g. `N 3`.|
|**4**|✅ **c**|✅|Right — both `systemctl rescue` and `systemctl isolate rescue.target` drop you into rescue (single-user) mode.|
|**5**|✅ **d**|✅|Yes — SysV uses only levels 0–6. Runlevel 7 doesn’t exist.|
|**6**|✅ **b**|✅|Exactly — `shutdown -r +5` means “reboot after 5 minutes.”|
|**7**|✅ **b**|✅|Correct — `systemctl set-default graphical.target` sets the default boot target (equivalent to runlevel 5).|
|**8**|✅ **a**|✅|Perfect — `multi-user.target` corresponds to runlevel 3 (multi-user text mode).|
|**9**|❌ **b**|✅ **d**|All listed commands (`init 6`, `systemctl reboot`, `reboot -f`) can trigger a reboot — depends on the init system in use.|
|**10**|❌ **b**|✅ **c**|`telinit q` tells init to re-examine `/etc/inittab` without rebooting, not to quit the process.|

### 🎯 **Final Score: 7 / 10**

Solid work again, Kev —  
you’re getting strong on **runlevel vs. systemd mapping** and **shutdown behavior**.  
The only misses were #1, #9, and #10 — all detail-based rather than conceptual. Keep this pace and 101.3 will be your strong suit on exam day.

# Post-evaluation Notes
Quite embarassing, TBH. I thought I could do better 😅.
