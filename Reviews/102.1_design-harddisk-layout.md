**1.** You are designing a Linux desktop system. You want to ensure that user data is preserved if the OS needs to be reinstalled. Which partitioning approach is best?  
a) Combine `/` and `/home` into a single partition  
🪙 b) Create a separate `/home` partition  
c) Put `/home` inside `/var`  
d) No partition needed; store data on `/tmp`

**2.** What is the **recommended minimum size** for a `/boot` partition?  
a) 100 MB  
🪙 b) 500 MB  
c) 1 GB  
d) 5 GB

**3.** Your server has 32 GB of RAM. You want to configure swap space primarily for hibernation. What is a reasonable swap size?  
a) 2 GB  
b) 16 GB  
🪙 c) 32 GB  
d) 64 GB

**4.** Which of the following directories is **recommended to have on a separate partition** to prevent system crashes due to large log files?  
a) `/tmp`  
b) `/usr`  
🪙 c) `/var`  
d) `/bin`

**5.** You are setting up a system that may require dynamic partition resizing in the future. Which technology should you use?  
a) RAID  
🪙 b) LVM  
c) Ext4  
d) Swap

**6.** Which of the following is a **security benefit** of separating `/tmp` onto its own partition?  
a) Easier backups  
b) Prevent log overflow  
🪙 c) Can mount with `noexec` to prevent execution of temporary scripts  
d) Faster disk I/O

**7.** You are designing a Linux server with 2 SSDs in a RAID1 configuration. You want to ensure the bootloader works even if one disk fails. What should you do?  
a) Put `/boot` on a separate partition on only the first disk  
🪙 b) Put `/boot` on a RAID1 mirrored partition  
c) Combine `/boot` and `/` on RAID0  
d) Mount `/boot` on `/home`

**8.** Which filesystem is most commonly used for `/` on modern Linux systems?  
a) ext2  
b) ext3  
🪙 c) ext4  
d) xfs

**9.** On a system with multiple partitions, which command shows **all mounted partitions and their usage**?  
a) `df -h`  
b) `lsblk`  
c) `mount`  
🪙 d) All of the above

**10.** For a server running databases and high log activity, which partitioning strategy is best?  
a) `/` only, everything else in root  
🪙 b) `/var` on a separate partition, `/home` separate for user data  
c) `/tmp` and `/home` combined  
d) `/boot` and `/` combined, everything else on swap

# Answers Evaluation 
### 🧾 **LPIC-1 102.1: Partition Design — Answer Key**

|#|Your Answer|✅ Correct|Explanation|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|b|✅|Correct — a separate `/home` partition preserves user data if the OS needs reinstallation.|
|2|b|✅|Correct — minimum `/boot` is typically 500 MB to accommodate kernels and initramfs.|
|3|c|✅|Correct — swap for hibernation must be at least equal to RAM (32 GB) to store memory contents.|
|4|c|✅|Correct — `/var` holds logs and databases; a separate partition prevents filling `/`.|
|5|b|✅|Correct — LVM allows dynamic resizing of partitions without repartitioning the disk.|
|6|c|✅|Correct — mounting `/tmp` with `noexec` prevents execution of malicious temporary scripts.|
|7|b|✅|Correct — `/boot` on RAID1 ensures the system can boot even if one disk fails.|
|8|c|✅|Correct — ext4 is the most widely used filesystem for root partitions on modern Linux systems.|
|9|d|✅|Correct — `df -h`, `lsblk`, and `mount` all provide mounted partition info; `df -h` is most common for usage.|
|10|b|✅|Correct — separating `/var` for logs/databases and `/home` for user data improves stability and manageability.|

All your answers are **100% correct**. 🎉

# Post-evaluation Notes

### **Quick Tips for Exams**

- Always justify separate partitions based on **security, manageability, and performance**.
- Separate `/var` for **servers with logs/databases**.
- Swap should match **hibernation requirements**.
- LVM gives **flexibility**, RAID gives **redundancy**.
- SSDs → frequent writes, consider smaller partitions for logs/temp.
- `/boot` ≥ 500 MB is enough for most kernels; never put `/boot` on RAID0.
