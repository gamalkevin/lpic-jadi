# 001-003 - Basics and Lab Installations

I have already watched these videos, and determined that there's no need to write down the notes of these videos.

I'll document my labs here anyway, shall the needs of references arise.

## Virt. Platform üèóÔ∏è

## Current Lab - Slackware
After a while, I realized both labs above to be redundant since I am already running Manjaro. However, I discovered later on ([video 009](./009_1-2-runlevels-targets-concepts.md)) that I needed to have a system with `sysvinit`. 

I already have AntiX and MX Linux with `sysvinit`, but both are installed on a USB drive. Since I don
