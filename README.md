# LPIC Learning with Jadi
As you might have caught on, I'm planning to get [LPIC-1 certification](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/lpic-1-overview/). Since I have no capital to invest in a 'serious' class for this, I'm going to use a free resource to my advantage. 

That's where [Jadi](https://www.youtube.com/c/geekingjadi), a veteran programmer who shares his knowledge through his YouTube channel, comes with his wonderful playlist of [LPIC 1 (Version 500)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFOYXCPEqdNUU55Xvgst8wGTWnz_sd-cj). People in the comments are praising and vouching Jadi for his exam-accurate and super helpful content. 

*My lazy ass* kept procrastinating the learning process. As of writing this, I've already spent half a month of no progress. I'm just getting started now, hah! *Well, better late than never!*

Before this, I have already watched video 001 through 003, which covers the basics and installation of two labs (Fedora and Ubuntu), so I'll skip the notes of both, since I already know how to do it without watching the video. However, see the next file for the documentation of labs that I prepared.
