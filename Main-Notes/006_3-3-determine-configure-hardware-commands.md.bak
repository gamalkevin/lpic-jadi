# 006 - 101.1 - Part 3 of 3 - Determine and Configure Hardware, Commands 📣
After learning about hardware, let's take a look into the 'basic' commands that touch them.

## **lsusb, lspci, lsblk, lshw**
If the command `ls` lists files, these commands list their respective hardwares. 

### lsusb
This command lists all USB devices connected to the system. Let's see mine:
```
$ lsusb
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 25a7:fa55 Areson Technology Corp Fantech Helios Pro Wireless XD3 
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 04ca:3015 Lite-On Technology Corp. Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377 Bluetooth
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 0408:a031 Quanta Computer, Inc. VGA WebCam
Bus 003 Device 003: ID 0bda:8179 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8188EUS 802.11n Wireless Network Adapter
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
```

### lspci
- Lists hardware connected through the PCI/PCIe bus (common connection method inside computers).
- *Examples: graphics card, network card, sound card, USB controllers.*
```

```
*Quite a list, huh? Wait 'till you see `lshw`.*

### lsblk
This is almost like a personal favorite; I use it a lot whenever doing partitioning or tinkering with USB bootables.

`lsblk` means **list block devices**. Block devices are devices that read/write in fixed-size blocks (e.g., hard drives, SSDs, USB sticks, partitions, even **loop devices** or **RAM disks**).
```
$ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda      8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk 
├─sda1   8:1    0   250G  0 part 
├─sda2   8:2    0   500M  0 part /boot
├─sda3   8:3    0   215G  0 part /
├─sda4   8:4    0   300M  0 part /boot/efi
├─sda5   8:5    0 372.6G  0 part 
├─sda6   8:6    0   732M  0 part 
├─sda7   8:7    0  30.7G  0 part 
└─sda8   8:8    0  61.7G  0 part 
sdb      8:16   0 119.2G  0 disk 
├─sdb1   8:17   0   499M  0 part 
├─sdb2   8:18   0   100M  0 part 
├─sdb3   8:19   0    16M  0 part 
├─sdb4   8:20   0 117.9G  0 part 
└─sdb5   8:21   0   741M  0 part 
```

#### Column meanings
**`MAJ:MIN` (Major:Minor number)**
- These are **device numbers** that the kernel uses internally.
- **Major**: identifies the driver for the device type (e.g., all SCSI/SATA disks share major number `8`).
- **Minor**: identifies the specific device or partition (e.g., `sda` is `8:0`, `sdb` is `8:16`, partitions increment from there).
- Users usually don’t need to care, but it’s how `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb1`, etc. are mapped.

**`RM` (Removable)**
- Shows whether the device is **removable** (`1`) or not (`0`).
- Example:
    - `sda` (internal HDD/SSD) → `0`
    - `sdb` (USB stick) → `1`

**`RO` (Read-Only)**
- Shows whether the device is **read-only** (`1`) or not (`0`).
- Example:
    - Normal drives → `0`
    - Mounted ISO file or write-protected USB → `1`

### lshw
- Stands for **List Hardware**.
- Shows **detailed information** about the system's hardware, and goes much deeper than `lsblk`, `lspci`, or `lsusb`.
- *Covers: CPU, RAM, motherboard, firmware/BIOS, storage, network cards, etc.*

Running `lshw` by itself, you will be suggested to run it with elevated commands, since it will yield more accurate results. I won't post my full `lshw` here, since it's incredibly long. 
- Even using `-short` option, it will still list all classes of hardware installed in your system. 
- You might want to run it using `-class` option, so it's easier to read through.

##  Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs)

- The **kernel** is the core of Linux.
- Normally, we’d have to **rebuild the whole kernel** to add new features (like support for new hardware).

👉 To avoid that, Linux uses **Loadable Kernel Modules**:
- **Small pieces of code** that can be added to (or removed from) the running kernel **without rebooting**.
- Think of them as **“plugins” for the kernel**.

### Examples
- Drivers for devices: Wi-Fi cards, USB devices, graphics drivers.
- Filesystem support: ext4, NTFS, FAT32.
- Network protocols or security modules.

### Commands to manage them
- `lsmod` → list currently loaded modules.
- `modprobe <module>` → load a module (and dependencies).
- `rmmod <module>` → remove a module.
- `modinfo <module>` → show info about a module.

Previously, `insmod` was used to load modules, but there were some downsides:
- `insmod` does not automatically handle dependencies; and
- The whole path to the module had to be inserted. Painfully annoying.
- Usage example:
	- `sudo insmod /lib/modules/5.15.0-xyz/kernel/drivers/net/wifi/wifi.ko`
- If the module requires another module first, `insmod` will **fail**.

So now, `modprobe` is the way to go. It handles dependencies automatically by consulting `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.dep`.

### Is it comparable to drivers on Windows?
Yes, **almost**. 

LKMs are **modular, can be inserted/removed at runtime**, whereas Windows drivers often come as part of the OS or installed manually and may require reboot for some changes.

To put simply:
- **Linux LKM = modular kernel code, usually drivers**    
- **Windows driver = usually hardware driver**
- **So yes, when talking about hardware, we can treat LKMs as the Linux equivalent of Windows drivers.**

### Interesting Notes
- Many hardware vendors don't provide proper driver (sometimes not even providing it altogether).
- Nvidia provides closed-source, binary-only drivers; a debatable decision in the community. 
	- There's a community-made one, but doesn't perform as well as Nvidia's proprietary driver.
- Nowadays, modern hardware accessories tend to be plug and play, since Linux kernel already include a lot of drivers. Many are reverse-engineered.
