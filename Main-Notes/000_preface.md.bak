# Preface
*Moved the actual preface  to [README.md](/README.md)*

## Current Progress
As of **28 Sept 2025**, I'm just getting started with video [012](https://youtu.be/WHsjpzCYXo8?si=qbm-kI3OkxxE3Hmj).

## ~~Target & Learning Strategy~~
~~I target to finish at least 1 video daily *(with strict adherence to '**the strategy**')*. The strategy is as follows:~~
- ~~Watch the video **twice**.~~
	- ~~First is watching the video by itself in **1.25x speed**, without jotting anything. I aim to get familiar with the flow.~~
	- ~~Second is watching the video in its normal speed, and pausing whenever necessary to take down notes.~~
- ~~After watching the video, skim-read again the written note; and~~
- ~~Practice/redo actions from the video *(if applicable)*~~

## Post Chapters
I will review a week of learning by skim-reading notes.

## Funny realization
As you might see, I [created and documented](001-003_basics-and-lab-installs.md) two virtual labs for this study project. Turns out, I don't quite need them, since I'm learning on Manjaro, which is already a Linux system.

Anyways, I decide to keep the document for archival purpose.
