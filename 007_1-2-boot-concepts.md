# 007 - 101.2 - Part 1 of 2 - The Boot Process; Concepts üìöÔ∏è

## The Boot Process
We have very little control during the first moments of turning on the computer. Let's understand more what's happening:
1. Motherboard firmware does a PowerOnSelfTest / **POST**
	1. It's checking whether the hardware are adequate to run the bootloader, which continues the booting process.
2. All is well, the motherboard loads the bootloader
3. Bootloader loads the kernel and its configs
	1. In GRUB (The current default bootloader for Linux), we can customize the behavior of the Linux distro that we're booting: different kernel versions, safe-mode, terminal only, etc.
	2. It can even detect other installed Linux distros and Windows too. 
4. Kernel loads, prepares the system / '**rootfs**' root filesystem and runs the initialization program / **init**
5. Init then loads system services (networking, GUI, etc.) and other startup programs.
6. System ready to use

## Boot Process Analogies
To understand the boot process, I headed to ChatGPT to obtain some useful analogies. Access them [here](./References/boot-process-analogies.md).
