# 005 - Part 2 of 3 - Determine and Configure Hardware, Kernel üåΩ
So we just learned about hardware in previous video, now we're diving into Linux system. Before we start on learning from the video, let's learn about...

## Linux Kernel
*Jadi doesn't cover this in the video, so I figured I get an info on this matter on my own.*

**üí° Quick analogy:**
- **Kernel:** The ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of the OS, controlling all operations.
- **User programs:** Workers asking the brain for resources.
- **Hardware:** Tools that the workers want to use.

### Kernel Definition
The **kernel** is the **core part of an operating system (OS)**. It acts as a bridge between:
1. **Hardware** (CPU, memory, disk, network, devices)    
2. **Software** (applications and user programs)

**In simple terms:** The kernel is the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù that lets software use hardware safely and efficiently.

With this definition, we might confuse it with **firmware**, but these two are not the same. Firmware is **low-level software embedded in hardware** while kernel is part of the **operating system**, not hardware.

Let's see how both of them interact: 
1. **Power on** ‚Üí firmware (BIOS/UEFI) runs, initializes hardware.
2. **Firmware** ‚Üí loads the bootloader.
3. **Bootloader** ‚Üí loads the kernel into memory.
4. **Kernel** ‚Üí takes over, initializes the OS, exposes devices via sysfs, `/proc`, `/dev`, etc.

## Sysfs
`Sysfs` is a **pseudo, virtual filesystem** in Linux.
- It is **mounted at `/sys`**.
- Purpose: Expose **kernel objects, attributes, and device info** to user space.
- Think of it as a **window into the kernel**, letting us inspect and sometimes configure devices, buses, and drivers.

It might look like a bunch of files, where we can `cd` and browse, but the files are not like common files. Sysfs is _readable and sometimes writable_, but it does **not exist on disk**; the kernel generates it dynamically.
