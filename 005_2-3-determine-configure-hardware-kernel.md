# 005 - Part 2 of 3 - Determine and Configure Hardware, Kernel 🌽
So we just learned about hardware in previous video, now we're diving into Linux system. Before we start on learning from the video, let's learn about...

## Linux **Kernel**
*Jadi doesn't cover this in the video, so I figured I get an info on this matter on my own.*

**💡 Quick analogy:**
